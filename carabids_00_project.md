Spring 2020 CU Boulder EBIO Ecological Forecasting Seminar
Project: NEON-Niwot forest species SDMs

This is a centralized location to organize our thoughts and resources for this project. Thoughts and data are focused on Niwot Ridge site, unless specified otherwise.

##### Scientific questions we could ask
1. How will carabid species distributions shift with global warming in a subalpine forest?  
1. Is there a shift in community composition through time at all in the NEON data available? For multiple sites, account for habitat and environmental differences. see Brooks et al. 2012 hyp1
1. Across NEON sites, do temporal community trends differ in magnitude and direction between habitats and regions? see Brooks et al. 2012 hyp2
1. Are community trends unique to combinations of habitats and regions? That is, might we expect species's responses to environmental change to be dictated mostly by habitat? see Brooks et al. 2012 hyp3
2. What are shifts in phenology of species through time? see Hoekman et al. 2017  
3. What is carabid community response to habitat and land-use change over time?  
4. What are shifts in phenology of species through time and across habitat? see Hoekman et al. 2017
5. Is fine-scale change in microhabitat heterogeneity more important to carabid abundance and richness than larger-scale changes in landscape diversity? Could more stable habitats (e.g. forest) buffer wider-scale perturbations? see Brooks et al. 2012
6. "How much data is enough to forecast accurately?": Develop a prediction model and run it (say) 35 years into the future. Assume this forecast data is real. Re-run the model, giving it varying amounts of "real" data (1 yr, 3 yrs, 5 yrs, 10 yrs etc). For each amount of "real" data, assess forecast accuracy at various timesteps; i.e. how far into the future can we accurately forecast with a given amount of "real" data? Figure out how to predict standard error change through time by simulating fake data.
7. Predict beetle abundance and and composition at a different spot in the same year. Or forecast rel abundance for the next collection period
8. Brett feedback from class pres - we're describing a bootstrapped forecast (generating fake data - if this is the truth, what uncertainty is there?) Think about the generative process in data collection

##### Why carabids?
* identifying habitat associations in a dominant insect group would be an important step toward understanding the consequences of global climate change in high mountain areas  (Hiramatsu and Usio 2018)
* Because of their known sensitivity to changes in habitat structure and requisitly altered microhabitat, carabid beetles have been suggested to serve as useful bioindicators of environmental and land use change (Hiramatsu and Usio 2018)
* To date, numerous studies have shown that carabid beetle richness and/or assemblage composition change along altitudinal gradients [5–7] and/or with vegetation type [8–11] (Hiramatsu and Usio 2018)
* Remote sensing can measure carabid habitat at the local and landscape scales. Identifying the predictive relationships between beetle assemblages to remote sensing variables allows conservation managers to measure carabids at a scale appropriate for their biology and scale up to that which management decisions function (Muller et al. 2009).

##### Carabid traits
These are the 7 most abundant and accurately identified species at Niwot Ridge.
| Species | Traits | Reference |
| ---| ----------------| ---|
| Amara alpina (Paykull 1790) | **Diet** Omnivores. Diet consists (likely in equal parts in terms of biomass) of animal prey and plant biomass, including bryophyte mosses and seeds **Phenology** Peak activity beginning of July in Norwegian mountains. Likely follows a univoltine life-cycle and can take up to 2 years to complete its life-cycle.  Prolonged life-cycle is an adaptation to life in the alpine-tundra environment with generally shorter seasons. Emerges right after snow melt, with males appearing earlier than females. **Reproduction** At peak activity, they copulate, lay their eggs, and many of the adults perish shortly after. Larvae probably hatch in the late summer/early fall. **Dispersal** Low rates of dispersal capability. Flying is sporadic, despite being winged (can be either macropterous or brachypterous). Running on the ground is common. Crucially, undergoes phases of immobility during development (eggs, larval pupation). Low mobility, at least during development, makes it more susceptible to elevational effects. Distances covered are likely to be less than 20 m per 24 h **Habitat** Low-middle alpine. Common inhabitant of open, alpine-tundra environment. Does not seem to favor drier soils, as other species of the genus seem to. Occurrence is stenotopic at ridges & widespread on slopes **Overwintering** Adults have been shown to hibernate during winter. However, larval overwintering (in the last instar) and consequent (quick) maturation in the following spring is also possible. The life-cycle may thus be very flexible. Hibernation of both developmental stages means that these species are well-equipped to act as colonizers and pioneers in the alpine. **Vegetation** lichen heath/ lichen-rich dwarf-shrub veg also: sparse veg., snow-bed & grass dominated veg. |[Naujok & Finch 2004](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256457268_Communities_and_spatio-temporal_patterns_of_epigeic_beetles_Coleoptera_in_high_mountain_habitats_of_the_Central_Norwegian_Scandes_with_special_emphasis_on_carabid_beetles_Carabidae) [Beckers et al. 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31979048) |
| Amara quenseli | Anna |   | 
| Calathus advena | Anna |   |
| Carabus taedatus | Anna |   |
| Cymindis unicolor | **Tribe**: Lebiini **Habitat**: An arctic-alpine species occurring in tundra and tundra-forest transition zones; inhabits treeless, well-drained environments |  [Garry 1990](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/book/386/chapter/3797287/Environmental-analysis-of-a-Twocreekan-aged-beetle) , [Nelson 1988](https://www-jstor-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/stable/4008554?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)| 
| Harpalus nigritarsis | **Tribe** Harpalini  **Diet** (for genus): seed-eaters as adults and typically also as larvae. **Phenology** annual life cycle |  Kent Wildlife Trust |
| Pterostichus restrictus | **Tribe** Pterostichini |   |

##### Data thoughts & questions
* How to choose which species to model? [Dittrich et al. 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/1/80/htm) chose species to reduce interannual variability by selecting ones that are (1) not directly depending on ephemeral resources and (2) nonspecific predators, feeding on various soil arthropods.
* Model occupancy or abundance? Maybe occupancy since we don't have abundant records
* Canopy structural variability seems like an important predictor (Davies & Asner 2014) - how to quantify this?
* Incorporate structural variables at trap-, plot-, and site-scales. Muller et al 2014 found higher arthropod diversity with increased canopy structural variability and density *at the tree scale*, but lower diversity *at the stand scale*
* Proxy for understory veg could be elevation or dist to stream
* NEON veg diversity data (2m scale cover)
* Climatic/meteorological variables: When Henry Nix started creating SDMs, bioclim was important> WorldClim should be at a fine enough scale for across-site NEON comparisons. Kiarney 2018 & 2019 (Methods in Ecology) used worldclim or bioclim to get 30m scale meteorological data for small-scale microclimate modeling

   * From the eight studies available for review, variability in the canopy profile (both vertical and horizontal), or ‘structural variability’ (Box 3), rather than a single structural metric, was most important for invertebrate assemblages
 * make species distribution models phylogenetically-informed? [Smith et al. 2018](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0169534718302696?token=75E2391C9E4901CA70BFE3188EE133719E1BD8CDBBEB7C0465F3156ECE20664743F44B95A73CB1DDD932089501F2BA27)
