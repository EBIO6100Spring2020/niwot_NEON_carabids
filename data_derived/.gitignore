# Use this to ignore large datasets in this directory

# This .gitignore is to share with everyone and should contain only rules that 
# are relevant to everyone. To exclude additional files only on your local 
# machine, use the "Explicit repository excludes" mechanism:
# https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files

# *.tif
rad_short_dir_diff_NIWO.Rdata
ir_bio_temp_NIWO.Rdata
*.grd
*.gri
model_sel*.Rdata


# Ignore the following subdirectories
