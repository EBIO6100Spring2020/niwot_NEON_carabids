# Brainstorming for forecasting final presentation

# Premise - Christa

##### Carabids
Why carabids? They're good indicators of environmental change, so creating accurate forecasts of them is helpful for understanding impacts of environmental change.  

##### Research questions
What were our questions
Hypothesized strong spatial/microhabitat effects
Predict when is peak abundance for each species in 2019. Assess based on timing and magnitude of peak. {Area under curve for total seasonal abundance}
Here, we focus on two species. Carabus taedatus (more in tundra) and Cymindis unicolor (more in fores) are the only two species present in both nlcdClass

Research questions we brainstormed earlier in the semester:  
1. For each species respectively, what are the key predictor variables (e.g. environmental, canopy cover, etc.)? (answered by collinearity and stepGAM)
2. What model best predicts species abundance spatially? (actually found most variation in temporal scale)
3. Leave out one plot or one from each biome from training set (predict plot 13) (base model vs model that fits data best)
4. Cross-validate chosen model. Which cross-validation method to use?
5. What model best predicts species abundance in the 2019 collection season?

## Carabid data

### Sampling

Carabid beetles were sampled at 10 plots, with 4 traps per plot. Beetles were collected every two weeks during the summer season (with temperature cutoffs to start and stop sampling). Data were available for 2015--2018 (2019 beetles were not yet identified). 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/canopy_height_traps.png")
```

In 2018, plot 4 was removed from sampling and plot 13 was added. Plot 4 was forested, and plot 13 is a tundra site. Plot 4 was likely removed from sampling due to low number of beetles caught (speculation from Matt Bitters). We took advantage of the new site in 2018 by using plot 13 as a test plot for our model predictions, which Anna will get to later.

### Identification
All individuals were identified to species (or morphospecies) by a parataxonomist. A subset (1511/1974) of those were then sent for expert identification. There was 97% agreement overall between the parataxonomist and the expert taxonomist.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 600}
knitr::include_graphics("output/paratax_vs_expertax.png")
```

<!-- ![species_abund_by_year_by_trap](output/paratax_vs_expertax.png) -->


### Species selection 
Most of the species collected were only found rarely, so we first narrowed down the set of species to the seven most abundant (and all were accurately ID'd). 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/species_through_years.png")
```

However, comparing multiple models across seven species is still a bit too much. To narrow further, we selected the two species of these seven that were found both above and below treeline. 

**Selected species**: 

*Carabus taedatus* is more abundant in tundra plots.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 100}
knitr::include_graphics("images/CARTAE.png")
```

*Cymindis unicolor* is more abundant in forested plots.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 50}
knitr::include_graphics("images/CYMUNI.png")
```

<!-- info/natural history about the species we chose
Do we have an idea for why certain carabids are greater in different nlcdClass given their biology?
-->

We chose these species because we thought it would be interesting to examine model performance for the species that were found in both habitats, especially since they show opposite trends in abundance in the two habitats.

### Abundance over time

<!-- by year -->
<!-- change to just the two species -->
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/species_abund_by_year_by_trap_nlcd.png")
```

This plot shows the abundances at each trap in each year for *Carabus taedatus* and *Cymindis unicolor*. *Carabus taedatus* was reliably caught at the tundra sites and was caught on occasion in some forested sites. *Cymindis unicolor* was reliably caught at some (but not all) forested sites and was caught on occasion at one tundra plot (8) and once at another tundra plot (6). 



## Predictor variables  
At the start of this project we spent some time brainstorming and searching the literature for potentially important predictor variables for carabid abundance. Once we had identified a long list of potential predictors, we searched through the available datasets for usable predictors. We ended up using predictor variables from three sources: NEON data included in the carabid data product, NEON AOP data products, and Niwot Ridge LTER environmental data. The predictors we used from each of these sources will be shown below. There were also several predictor variables that we were not able to use: soil moisture (NEON product, not colocated with beetle traps), woody debris (NEON product, not colocated with beetle traps), vegetation (NEON product, difficult to summarize at plot or trap level), and snowmelt date (didn't find or have time to incorporate).

#### Included with carabid data product
Day of year - extracted from collect date  
NLCD class - evergreen forest or grassland herbaceous  
Elevation  

#### AOP (remote sensing) data products 
Data products from NEON's AOP collection were downloaded via the `neonUtilities` package in the form of multiple (over 100) .tif files in a zip folder for each data product. We then merged together all of the .tif's into a single raster in R (`carabids_01_download_AOP.R`) for each data product. These rasters were then used for all of our downstream analyses.

**Canopy height**  
Measured via LIDAR, this data product provides a 1x1m resolution map of canopy height across the site. To summarize for each trap, we took the average canopy height for a 10m radius from each trap location (see`raster::extract` in `carabids_03_EDA_CHM`). 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 600}
knitr::include_graphics("output/canopy_height_traps.png")
```



**Leaf area index**  
This is the ratio of leaf area to bare ground area as sensed from above (similar metric to percent canopy cover). This was processed the same way as canopy height, but with some extra data cleaning. Data were available for 2017, 2018, and 2019, but the data looked different year to year. In the end, we used an average of 2017 and 2018 because these issues were difficult to sort out and those years were similar and appeared the most reliable. After contacting someone at NEON, we learned that they used different quality control measures in different years resulting in different values.

**Slope and aspect**  
Slope and aspect were summarized at the plot level (average slope and aspect at 10m radius from plot center). We included them because they may be related to microclimatic factors such as soil moisture (slope) and energy availability via sun exposure (aspect).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 400}
knitr::include_graphics("output/slope_traps.png")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 400}
knitr::include_graphics("output/aspect_traps.png")
```

#### Niwot Ridge LTER data sources
**Precipitation**  
For the forested plots, C1 precipitation data were used; for the tundra plots Saddle precipitation data were used. [NEON also has a precipitation data product, but there were too many missing data points for our use.] We calculated total precipitation during the collection period (2 weeks) for each collect date. This summary gets at the short-term weather patterns that may influence beetle behavior and detectability in traps. [We wanted to get to a long-term precipitation summary, but ran out of time.]
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/precip_2week_summ.png")
```

**Growing degree days**  
Using temperature data from the C1 sensor (Saddle sensor data contained missing dates), we calculated growing degree days. Growing degree days were summarized similar to (Nufio et al. 2010) as a cumulative sum of growing degree days in that year until the date of collection. Degree days were quantified for temperatures between 12--33C based on grasshopper physiology at Niwot Ridge (Nufio et al. 2010). We did not have any information regarding the carabid temperature limits, so grasshopper values from the same location were our best estimate.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/temp_time.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/degree_days_cumulative.png")
```

# Model building and selection - Anna

Research Q1. For each species respectively, what are the key predictor variables (e.g. environmental, canopy cover, etc.)? (answered by collinearity and stepGAM)

Research Q2. What model best predicts species abundance? 

GAMMs performed better than GLMMs (lower AIC) AND we wanted to use a spline to capture DOY (seasonality)

Melissa's stepGAM

Collinearity test helped cut out some predictor variables

Base model to test for how much variance is in each grouping variable (GAM with just grouping variables)

zero-inflated model? 

ending with one model that we deem the best for each species



#### Results & Interpretation

interpret plots of gams biologically. do these make sense? Interpret model results with biology in mind... do these results make sense given that this species is more abundant in the tundra?...

compare 'best fit' model to 'base' model

{then simulate results - how good is our model - Grant: simulation results}

Research Q3. Leave out one plot or one from each biome from training set (predict plot 13) (base model vs model that fits data best) - validate on testing data

Research Q4. Cross-validate chosen model. Which cross-validation method to use? show cross validation: MSE

Did we do what we set out to do?
