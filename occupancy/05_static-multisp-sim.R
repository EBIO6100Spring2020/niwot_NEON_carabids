# This script models the static occupancy of two species by simulation. Following example from Bayesian Population Analysis (Kery & Schaub 2012) section 13.6 and Mackenzie et al. 2004a. This is a multi-state model with possible states: “occupied by both species”, “occupied by species A only”, “occupied by species B only”, "occupied by neither species". We use a multinomial parameterization to describe the probability structure for the occupancy state of a unit

# Scenario 1: {0·4, 0·4, 0·08}, low prob of species occupying a site, species exhibit low association 
# Scenario 2: {0·4, 0·4, 0·24}, low prob of species occupying a site, species exhibit high association 
# Scenario 3: {0·7, 0·7, 0·4}, high prob of species occupying a site, species exhibit low association
# Scenario 2: {0·7, 0·7, 0·6125}, high prob of species occupying a site, species exhibit high association
