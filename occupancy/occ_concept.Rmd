This script is meant to write out and explain the mathematical intuition for these occupancy models


for each spatial replicate
    $z_i \sim Bernoulli( \psi )$ # True occurrence z at plot i 
    $logit(\psi_i) = -lpsi.lim[i]?$ 
    psi[i] <- 1 / (1 + exp(-lpsi.lim[i])) 
    lpsi.lim[i] <- min(999, max(-999, lpsi[i]))  #AIS what does this line do?
    lpsi[i] <- alpha.psi + beta.psi * nlcd[i]
    # Observation model for replicated detection/nondetection observations
    
    for each survey in a season 
        y[i,j] ~ dbern(mu.p[i,j]) # Detection-nondetection at plot i and survey j 
        mu.p[i,j] <- z[i] * p[i,j] 
        p[i,j] <- 1 / (1 + exp(-lp.lim[i,j])) 
        lp.lim[i,j] <- min(999, max(-999, lp[i,j])) 
        lp[i,j] <- alpha.p + 
            beta1.p * sc_doy[i,j] + beta2.p * pow(sc_doy[i,j], 2)
