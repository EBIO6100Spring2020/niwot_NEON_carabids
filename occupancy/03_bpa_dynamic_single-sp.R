# This script builds a dynamic occupancy model for a single species using simulated data. A dynamic occupancy model estimates changes in z, probability of occupancy, across seasons. Followed model in section 13.5 of Bayesian Population Analysis (Kery & Schaub 2012).

# Seasons over a series of years represent an common, natural grouping factor, where each year is the primary sampling occasion and the surveys within each year are secondary sampling occasions. It is natural then to assume closure among secondary seasons within a primary season.
