# Brainstorming for forecasting final presentation

# Premise


# What were our questions
# Hypothesized strong spatial/microhabitat effects
# Predict when is peak abundance for each species in 2019. Assess based on timing and magnitude of peak. Area under curve for total seasonal abundance
# Here, we focus on two species. Carabus taedatus (more in tundra) and Cymindis unicolor (more in fores) are the only two species present in both nlcdClass


# EDA
# Beetles...
# 
# The literature supported certain explanatory variables, but we didn't some of these to explain much variance in our models.
# 
#  Predictor variables...
# How did we calculate LAI (and other AOP data products) for each trap?
    # How did we decide on what size buffer to use for these calculations?


# Model 
# compare GAMM and GLMM?


# Results and conclusions
# Did not find strong spatial effect, but did find noticeable temporal effects
